    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that we can <a href="/2012/07/11/use-rsync-and-cron-to-do-regular-backup-part-i">take advantage of rsync to minimize the data to transfer when
backup</a>. But it's still a little uncomfortable if we need to do this manually
everyday, right? Well, cron is here to solve the pain.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a> is kind of a system service that
automatically do some job as you specified. Backup, for example, is a perfect
kind of job that we can count on cron.</p>

<p>First, we need to specify a job that we want cron to do. In my case, I want
cron to automatically sync my source tree folder on remote data center and my
local backup folder. A simple rsync command seems meet my need. But actually,
there are more to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't want to copy the obj files, since they are normally large in size
and change frequently, but can be easily re-generated. But I also don't want to
skip the entire build folder when do rsync since there are some configure files
in there.</p></li>
<li><p>The backup process should be totally automated. More specifically, no
password is needed when do rysnc.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Towards the first need, I can use ssh to send remote command to
do necessary clean up work before rysnc. And the second need can
be meted according to my previous post about <a href="/2012/04/27/sshscp-without-password">ssh/scp without password</a>.</p>

<p>So my final backup script looks like this:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<h1>~/backup.sh</h1>

<p>LOG_FILE=~/backup.log
SOURCE_DIR=b@B:~/src/
TARGET_DIR=~/src_backup</p>

<p>date >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Synchronization start..." >> $LOG_FILE
ssh b@B 'cd ~/src/build; make clean; rm -rf obj/" >> $LOG_FILE
rsync -avz --exclude "tags" $SOURCE_DIR $TARGET_DIR >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Synchronization done" >> $LOG_FILE
```</p>

<p>Once we figure out what to do, we need to tell cron about our job. The
configure file of cron is <code>/etc/crontab</code>. A job description is like follows:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>Example of job definition:</h1>

<h1>.----------------minute (0 - 59)</h1>

<h1>| .------------- hour (0 - 23)</h1>

<h1>| | .---------- day of month (1 - 31)</h1>

<h1>| | | .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...</h1>

<h1>| | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat</h1>

<h1>| | | | |</h1>

<h1>* * * * * user-name command to be executed 0 0 * * * jack ~/backup.sh</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>I want to do backup every day on midnight so I set the minute and hour both to
0. The asterisk (<code>*</code>) symbol in day/month means any valid values.</p>

<p>Now we are done. The back up process is completely automated and scheduled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I do most of my work on a remote data center through a slow network
connection (&lt;100KB/sec). I usually backup my project source tree as follows.
I first do make clean and also delete any unnecessary obj files to shrink the
total file size, then I compress the whole source tree as a tar ball and then I
use <code>scp</code> locally to fetch the backup tar ball to my local machine. The procedure
is quite boring since I need to do this every day before I go home, otherwise
the whole bandwidth will be occupied for near an hour during which I can almost
do nothing.</p>

<p>Situation gets better when I find <code>rsync</code> and <code>cron</code>. Here is how I do automatic
regular (daily) backup with them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">Rsync</a> is a file synchronization tool
that aims to minimize the data transfer during copy files. This is done via
only send the diffs to destination. It is perfect when you need to do regular
copy between two fixed locations. Rsync has many options (well, as most of
other GNU tools), here is two of them that are used more frequently:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>ensure that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions,</h1>

<h1>ownerships, etc are preserved in the transfer</h1>

<p>-a, --archive</p>

<h1>compress data during transfer, especially useful when the bandwidth is limited</h1>

<p>-z, --compress</p>

<h1>exclude the directories or files that you don't want to sync, such as obj</h1>

<h1>files, tag files, etc</h1>

<p>--exclude
<code>``
Suppose that you have a source tree on host B:</code>~/src<code>, and you want to sync this
source tree with a local folder named:</code>~/src_backup`, then the follow command
will suffice:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ rsync -avz --exclude "obj/" --exclude "tags" --exclude "build" b@B:~/src/ ~/src_backup
</code></p>

<p>The two exclude option will tell rsync to skip the obj subdirectory as well
as the tags file. The trailing slash in the source (<code>b@B:~/src/</code>) will tell
rsync not to create an additional directory level at the destination. Without
this slash, rsync will create a <code>src</code> directory under <code>~/src_backup</code>, which is not
desirable.</p>

<p>Now that after the first time rsync, the following rsync commands will only
transfer the file changes to local, which is a great save of the bandwidth.</p>

    <id>http://jhshi.me/2012/04/27/sshscp-without-password</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you have two machines: A and B. A is your work machine, you do most of
your work on it. But B is a little special (e.g., connected to some specific
hardware) that you need to ssh on it or copy some file from A to B from time to
time. Here is the way that you can get rid of entering passwords every time you
do ssh/scp.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, on machine A, generate a DSA key pair:</p>

<p>```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (YOUR_HOME/.ssh/id_rsa):</p>

<h1>press ENTER here to accept the default filename</h1>

<p>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</p>

<h1>press ENTER here to use no passphrase, otherwise, you still need</h1>

<h1>to enter this passphrase when ssh</h1>

<p>Enter same passphrase again:</p>

<h1>press ENTER here</h1>

<p>Your identification has been saved in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is: ..... (omited)
```</p>

<p>Then, change the access mode of .ssh directory</p>

<p><code>bash
$ chmod 775 ~/.ssh
</code></p>

<p>Then append the content of your just generated <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to the
<code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file on machine B:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>copy the id_rsa.pub file to host B</h1>

<p>$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub b@B:.</p>

<h1>login to B</h1>

<p>$ ssh b@B</p>

<h1>append the content to authorized_keys</h1>

<p>$ cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```</p>

<p>Finally, ssh on to B and change the access mode of the file <code>authorized_keys</code>.
This is optional, maybe you don't need to do this if you can already ssh
without entering password.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ ssh b@B
$ chmod 700 .ssh
$ chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></p>

<p>Depend on your version of ssh, you may also need to do the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ ssh b@B $ cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
</code></p>

<p>That it! Enjoy!</p>
